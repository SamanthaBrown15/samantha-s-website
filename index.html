               <h3>Experience</h3>
      
                 <p> My Experirence in Englewood codes has been the best expereince I had thust far.I've meet alot of amazing people, I had a chance to be  in a group called  Pheneomal Women, and I  had the honor to build a winning website with my group.Being in the group gained me some friends with beautiful hearts that took us far together in this program. the Program also had it's rainy days, It were times where I gave up but i remmbered giving up doesnt take you anywhere it just keeps you in the same spot you started in but taking whatever challenges life throws at you shows that you are ready for anything.   </p>
